/**
 * Guards the handful of invariants the narrow layout rests on.
 *
 * The e2e `mobile` project proves the shell behaves at 390px, but it can only check pages it
 * visits, and it cannot see a rule that is *about* to break something. These are the mistakes
 * that are invisible in a diff, cheap to make, and expensive to find by eye on a phone:
 *
 *   1. One breakpoint. It lives in ViewportService and in a media query in each component that
 *      needs one, and those must agree — a shell that reflows at 768px with a table that reflows
 *      at 640px has a band where the sidebar is a drawer and the table is still a table.
 *   2. No `100vh` on a full-height container. Mobile browsers measure vh against the viewport
 *      with the URL bar retracted, so 100vh is taller than the screen and the bottom of the page
 *      sits under the browser chrome. `100dvh` is the fix and there is no reason to reintroduce
 *      the other.
 *   3. No fixed pixel widths wide enough to force a horizontal scroll at the narrowest supported
 *      viewport.
 *
 * Deliberately narrow. This is not a general responsive-design linter — it checks three things
 * that have a single correct answer, and stays quiet about everything that is a judgement call.
