/**
 * The identity-provider route on the login page, in front of a real Fineract.
 *
 * The one thing this alters is the deployment's own `config.json`, which gets `oidcLoginEnabled`
 * added to whatever it already says. That is what a deployment does by hand — the flag is not
 * read from Fineract (issue #370) — so it is the honest way to switch the route on. Everything
 * after it is real: the credentials, the platform's answer and the session that results.
 *
 * `oidc-login.spec.ts` covers the matrix against mocks, including the configurations that must
 * show nothing. This covers what mocks cannot: that offering the route leaves a real sign-in
 * working, and that pressing it does not reach Fineract at all.
